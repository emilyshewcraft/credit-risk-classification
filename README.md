Module 20 Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis

For this analysis, I used supervised machine learning models to predict credit risk of loans.

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Loan data was split between training and testing sets.
* A logistic regressiion model was used to train the data.
* Predictions were made based on a loan status of 0 (healthy loan) or 1 (high-risk loan).

## Results

* Machine Learning Model:
  * Overall accuracy: 99%
  * Precision: 100% (healthy), 87% (high-risk)
  * Recall: 100% (healthy), 89% (high-risk)


## Summary

Overall, the Logistic Regression model was highly accurate in predicting credit risk of loans.
